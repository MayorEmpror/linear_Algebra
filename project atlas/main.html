        Carbon is the fourth-most-abundant element in the universe and,
        depending on the arrangements of carbon atoms, takes on a wide variety
        of forms, called allotropes. Carbon allotropes exhibit unique properties
        of strength and electrical conductivity. Solid carbon at room
        temperature has two classical structures: diamond and graphite. In 1985
        the discovery of the existence of a third and new carbon allotrope
        containing sixty perfectly symmetrically arranged carbon atoms (also
        known as C60, fullerene, or buckyballs) meant a major breakthrough and
        opened a novel field of carbon nanochemistry. Then, in 1991, carbon
        nanotubes were discovered and graphene in 2004.

            Three of the four outer- electrons of each atom in a graphene sheet
            occupy three sp2 – a combination of orbitals s, px and py — that are
            shared with the three nearest atoms, forming . The length of these
            is about 0.142 . The remaining outer-shell electron occupies a pz
            orbital that is oriented perpendicularly to the plane. These
            orbitals hybridize together to form two half-filled of free-moving
            electrons, π and π∗, which are responsible for most of graphene's
            notable electronic properties Graphene sheets stack to form graphite
            with an interplanar spacing of 0.335nm
            <h1>Geometry</h1>
            The hexagonal lattice of isolated, single-layer graphene can be
            directly seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of sheets
            of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid A single layer
            of carbon atoms arranged in such a honeycomb structure forms a
            single graphene sheet. Several sheets stacked one on top of the
            other are regarded as multi-layer graphene, up to the point where
            the material becomes graphite (usually over about 30 layers In
            graphene, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other
            carbon atoms. Thanks to the the strength of the covalent bonds
            between carbon atoms, graphene boasts great stability and a very
            high tensile strength (the force in which you can stretch something
            before it breaks). Since graphene is flat, every atom is on the
            surface and is accessible from both sides, so there is more
            interaction with surrounding molecules.

        A team of University of Maryland scientists have discovered that when
        electric current is run through carbon nanotubes, objects nearby heat up
        while the nanotubes themselves stay cool, like a toaster that burns
        bread without getting hot. Understanding this completely unexpected new
        phenomenon could lead to new ways of building computer processors that
        can run at higher speeds without overheating. Carbon nanotubes, with
        their unique physical properties, have the potential to outperform
        conventionally used electrical wiring metals. Any improvement in this
        area of technology would be of great importance to industry, the
        economy, and the environment, as the global need for electrical energy
        and its efficient transfer and conversion rapidly increases. Carbon
        nanotube fibers, which are assemblies made purely of carbon nanotubes,
        can uniquely be used in macroscopic electrical applications including
        electrical wires and devices where the operation is enabled by these
        conductors.
